The reason is convenience and the certainty that a payment won't be skipped. For the same reasons, the Electronic Giving Program benefits those who want to faithfully and consistently provide their offerings to the parish.</p><br/>								<h5>Will it cost me anything?</h5>								<p>No, the parish will cover the small monthly service and transaction fees.</p><br/>								<h5>How often will I be able to give electronically?</h5>								<p>Accounts can be debited weekly or monthly or just one time. Your account will be debited on the day of your choosing.  The options are on the 5th, 15th or 25th of each month or on a weekly basis. If the day falls on a weekend or holiday, the debit will occur on the next business day.</p><br/>								<h5>Can I change the amount of my offering transfer?</h5>								<p>Yes, you may do so by going online and changing it in the Donation area or by sending an email to             <a href="mailto:Donations@stjohnsfolsom.org">Donations@stjohnsfolsom.org</a>.  In either case, you will receive an email confirming that your request has been processed.</p>  <br/>								<h5>Can I add to my deduction for holidays like Easter and Christmas, etc?</h5>								<p>Yes. A one time deduction can be made at any time to make a greater donation for a special holiday or special time of year. </p><br/>								<h5>Can I designate where my donations will go?</h5>								<p>Yes, simply choose the designated areas and fill in the amount of your donation.  You will see the total of your designated choices when you have finished making your entries.</p><br/>								<h5>What are the benefits?</h5>								<p>Parishioners who work on weekends, go away on vacation, are out of town on Sundays or are no longer able to attend church due to health reasons can stay financially connected to the church. Parishioners will not have to worry about forgetting their envelopes. Electronic Giving makes it easier to manage our budget because the parish can rely on guaranteed income every month. The program will automatically keep track of your deductions and provide a statement of all of your deductions at the end of the year.</p><br/>								<h5>What is the benefit to the church if parishioners use automatic offertory?</h5> 								<p>This program can save a great deal of time with regard to volunteers. The amount of time needed for the weekly counting of donations is reduced, money is automatically deposited into the church’s account, and reports are readily available. It also gives the church an amount of money they can count on every month to pay the bills, instead of guessing what donations might or might not come in. This also reduces the need for weekly collection envelopes. </p><br/>								<h5>How do I sign up for automatic offertory?</h5>								<p>Simply click on the “Donate Now” icon on the top of the page and then fill out the necessary areas on the Donation Page.  It’s that simple.</p><br/>								<hr>								<p>If you have any questions not covered by the above information, please email us at <a href="mailto:donations@stjohnsfolsom.org">donations@stjohnsfolsom.org</a></p> 									-->					                										</div>						</div>						<!-- incol1 end -->						<!-- incol2 start -->						<div class="incol2 ">											</div>						<!-- incol2 end -->						<div class="sptr1"></div>					</div>							</div>						<!-- contant end -->						<!-- footer start -->				<div class="footer italic-georgia">					<div class="footer-l">						<div class="footer-r">							<div class="container">								<dl>									<dd class="footer-links"><a  href="index.html">Home</a> | <a href="newcomers.html">Newcomers</a> | <a href="sacraments.html">Sacraments</a> | <a href="special-events.html">Special Events</a> | <a href="resources.html">Contacts &amp; Resources</a> | <a href="parishioners.html">Parishioners' Access</a> |  <a href="parishioners-04.html">Site Map</a></dd>									<dd class="column-l">Copyright &copy; 2015 St. John the Baptist Catholic Church.
